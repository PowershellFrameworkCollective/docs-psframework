Just released [v1.13.414 of the PSFramework module](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework/blob/development/PSFramework/changelog.md#113414-2025-10-14)!

The key feature for this release is the `Invoke-PSFRunspace` command, beyond which a few minor fixes and tweaks were included:

+ New Options for Tab Expansion Scriptblocks: It is now possible to disable automatic filtering (in case you want to do your own), or limit the maximum number of completions shown.
+ Waiting for a [Runspace Workflow](https://psframework.org/docs/PSFramework/RunspaceWorkflows/overview) to complete now supports showing a progress bar

> Invoke-PSFRunspace

The idea behind this command is to step into the role of both `ForEach-Object -Parallel` and `Start-ThreadJob`, granting access to their functionality for both Windows PowerShell (5.1) and later core versions (7.*).
And improve upon it.

A few example usages:

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Invoke-PSFRunspace { $_ | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership }
```

Retrieve all users from Active Directory, then retrieve their group memberships

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Invoke-PSFRunspace { $_ | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership } -OutputStyle Result
```

Retrieve all users from Active Directory, then retrieve their group memberships, returning a report object, mapping each user to their group memberships.

```powershell
$task = Get-ADUser -Filter * | Invoke-PSFRunspace { $_ | Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership }

# Collect the data received so far
$task.CollectCurrentResult()

# Wait until completed and collact all remaining results
$task.CollectResult()
```

First start searching for all users' group memberships.
Then later collect some or all the results in convenient result datasets, mapping input to output and including all errors / warnings / etc.
