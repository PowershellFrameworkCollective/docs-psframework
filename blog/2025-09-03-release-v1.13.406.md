Just released [v1.13.406 of the PSFramework module](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework/blob/development/PSFramework/changelog.md#113406-2025-08-29)!

This comes with a huge range of changes, far more than can usefully put into an announcement blog post.

A few highlights:

+ [Tab Completion can now learn](https://psframework.org/docs/PSFramework/TabExpansion/Basics/training-completers)
+ [Hashtables just got better](https://psframework.org/docs/PSFramework/Utility/Features/psfhashtables)
+ [Who wants to resolve paths themselves](https://psframework.org/docs/PSFramework/ParameterClasses/path-parameter)? Introducing a vastly expanded range of path resolution parameter classes.
+ [Logging to logfile finally can do plaintext](https://psframework.org/docs/PSFramework/Logging/loggingto/logfile) if you really, really, really want to (why would you though? Structured data is so much cooler)
+ `Get-PSFFileContent` & `Set-PSFFileContent` makes writing/reading to/from file consistent across PS Version with better encoding support
+ `Import-PSFJson` / `Export-PSFJson` for greater convenience and consistent encoding handling.
+ `ConvertTo-PSFPsd1` & `Export-PSFPowerShellDataFile` finally allow generating psd1 files programmatically.
