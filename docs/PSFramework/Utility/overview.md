# Utility

## Synopsis

Utility is the catch-all category for individual commands and features that do not fit into any more specific category or would be a category ontu themselves.
While it is hard to convey the value of a category of tools that each do their own thing and solve their own problem, they have the advantage of being generally fast and simple to adopt, giving a fast return on the effort.

## Commands

Simple standalone commands that offer value:

+ [Select-PSFObject](Commands/select-psfobject.md): Expanding the default `Select-Object` with extra convenience. And a bit of magic.
+ [ConvertFrom-PSFArray](Commands/convertfrom-psfarray.md): Flatten array-properties on objects, to keep them pretty when exporting to CSV.

## Micro-Features

+ [PSFramework Hashtables](Features/psfhashtables.html): Extending hashtables to be better.
