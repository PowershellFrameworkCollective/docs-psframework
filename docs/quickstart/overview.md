# Quickstart Overview

Welcome to the PSFramework project.

Not only do I rarely enjoy writing documentation, I figure you also don't much care to have to read it.
If you are wondering how to quickly get started, how to swiftly gain some benefit out of this massive toolkit, you have come to the right place.

See below in the navigation menu for some quick wins, some simple ways to get some swift benefit out of these modules.

A quick orientation though:

+ PSFramework: The module that you take a dependency on, that offers tools for your code to use
+ PSModuleDevelopment: The developer toolkit that helps you generate code

Seeing is believing.
If you prefer to watch a demo over reading docs (and who doesn't?), here is a quick intro to what PSFramework can do for you:
